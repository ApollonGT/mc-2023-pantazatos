**Summary**

In the realm of natural language processing, this diploma thesis delves into applying four advanced language models, namely BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and ELECTRA, into classifying sentiment in the top 250 IMDB movie reviews. The sentiment classification is based on the dichotomy of positive and negative sentiment, where reviews with scores exceeding seven are categorized as positive, and those at seven or lower are deemed negative. The research journey encompasses various stages, from data acquisition to model implementation and explainability.

The process initiates with developing a web scraper utilizing Selenium to extract the desired movie reviews from the IMDB platform. These reviews undergo preprocessing to optimize compatibility with the language models. A comprehensive dataset detailing the extracted reviews is presented through an interactive dashboard, providing a visual overview of the collected data.

The crux of the study involves employing the selected language models for sentiment classification. Each model undergoes extensive training and fine-tuning to harness its capabilities in understanding and classifying the nuanced sentiments expressed in the reviews. Furthermore, the thesis explores the realm of explainability, implementing two distinct techniques—LIME and SHAP—to shed light on the decision-making process of the models. This endeavor provides insights into the features driving the predictions, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of the model's outcomes.

This work's culmination encompasses applying advanced language models to sentiment classification and delves into the realm of explainable artificial intelligence, enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of the models' decisions.
